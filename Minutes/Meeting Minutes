Meeting was remote on account of unsafe road conditions and as such the group elected to host a remote group call 

Discussed the critiques put forward by client on Wednesday in-class meeting and how to apply them to next step 

Reaffirmed the separation of workload, with Andrew on Treasurer use-cases, Manny on Admin use-cases, and Nick on Standard User use-cases. 

Set a personal completion of each use-case set by each member for 2/15/2025, 11:59 P.M. 

Communicated expectations for length and complexity of use-case documents. Special note was given to ensuring that each step of the process would be explained in exhaustive detail 

Set time for review of documents after deadline for class time on 2/17/2025 

Shared group questions and concerns, and addressed them as needed
